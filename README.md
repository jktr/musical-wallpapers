# musical-wallpapers

Changes your wallpaper based on currently playing track's cover art.

The script discovers the cover art automatically and uses a fancy
vertical video blur to generate a wallpaper from it, defaulting to
~/.wallpaper otherwise. External displays and screen rotation are also
handled correctly (and applied on track change).

Note that this script assumes that sway is in use and that your MPD
database is available locally.
